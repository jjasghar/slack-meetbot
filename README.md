## Debugging

The bot includes a comprehensive logging system that can be enabled by setting `DEBUG=true` in your `.env` file. When debug mode is enabled, you'll see detailed information about:

- Application startup and initialization
- Command reception and processing
- Database operations
- Error details
- Message handling
- User interactions

Debug logs include timestamps and log levels, making it easier to track down issues. Example debug output:

```
2024-01-20 10:30:45 - meetbot - INFO - Debug mode is enabled - you'll see detailed logging
2024-01-20 10:30:45 - meetbot - INFO - Slack app initialized successfully
2024-01-20 10:30:45 - meetbot - INFO - Database initialized successfully
2024-01-20 10:30:45 - meetbot - INFO - Jinja2 environment initialized successfully
2024-01-20 10:30:45 - meetbot - INFO - Starting Slack MeetBot...
2024-01-20 10:30:45 - meetbot - INFO - Bot is ready! Listening for events...
2024-01-20 10:31:00 - meetbot - DEBUG - Received /meeting command: {...}
```

To enable debug mode:
1. Add `DEBUG=true` to your `.env` file
2. Restart the bot
3. Watch the console for detailed logging information

To disable debug mode:
1. Set `DEBUG=false` in your `.env` file (or remove the line)
2. Restart the bot

## Commands

The bot supports both slash commands and message-based commands with the `!` prefix. You can use either format:

### Meeting Management
- Start a meeting:
  - `/meeting start` or `!meeting start`
- End a meeting:
  - `/meeting end` or `!meeting end`

### Role Management
- Change the chair:
  - `/chair @user` or `!chair @user`
- Add a co-chair:
  - `/cochair @user` or `!cochair @user`

### Action Items and Stats
- Create an action item:
  - `/action @user task` or `!action @user task`
- View participation stats:
  - `/stats` or `!stats`
- Export meeting minutes:
  - `/export` or `!export`

### Karma System
- View karma standings:
  - `/karma` or `!karma`
- Give karma points:
  - `/karma @user` or `!karma @user`
  - `@user++` (alternative syntax)

## Meeting Minutes Export

The bot automatically exports meeting minutes as HTML files to the `exports` directory. The export includes:
- Meeting metadata (time, date, channel)
- Participants and roles
- Complete message transcript
- Action items
- Participation statistics

## Database

The bot uses SQLite for data storage. The database (`meetbot.db`) will be created automatically on first run and includes tables for:
- Meetings
- Messages
- Action Items
- Co-chairs
- Speaker Statistics
- User Karma

## Karma System

The karma system allows team members to recognize and appreciate each other's contributions. There are three ways to give karma points:

1. Using the slash command:
   ```
   /karma @user
   ```

2. Using the message command:
   ```
   !karma @user
   ```

3. Using the ++ syntax:
   ```
   @user++
   ```

To view karma standings, use either:
```
/karma
```
or
```
!karma
```

Rules:
- Users cannot give karma points to themselves
- Each karma action gives one point
- Karma points are tracked globally across all channels
- Karma standings show all users sorted by points
