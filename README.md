## Commands

The bot supports both slash commands and message-based commands with the `!` prefix. You can use either format:

### Meeting Management
- Start a meeting: `!meeting start`
- End a meeting: `!meeting end`

### Role Management
- Change the chair: `!chair @user`
- Add a co-chair: `!cochair @user`

### Action Items and Stats
- Create an action item: `!action @user task`
- View participation stats: `!stats`
- Export meeting minutes: `!export`

### Karma System
- View karma standings: `!karma`
- Give karma points: `!karma @user` or `@user++` (alternative syntax)

## Meeting Minutes Export

The bot automatically exports meeting minutes as HTML files to the `exports` directory. The export includes:
- Meeting metadata (time, date, channel)
- Participants and roles
- Complete message transcript
- Action items
- Participation statistics

## Database

The bot uses SQLite for data storage. The database (`meetbot.db`) will be created automatically on first run and includes tables for:
- Meetings
- Messages
- Action Items
- Co-chairs
- Speaker Statistics
- User Karma

## Karma System

The karma system allows team members to recognize and appreciate each other's contributions. There are three ways to give karma points:

1. Using the message command:
   ```
   !karma @user
   ```

2. Using the ++ syntax:
   ```
   @user++
   ```

Rules:
- Users cannot give karma points to themselves
- Each karma action gives one point
- Karma points are tracked globally across all channels
- Karma standings show all users sorted by points
